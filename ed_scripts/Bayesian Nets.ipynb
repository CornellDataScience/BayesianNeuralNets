    "# Introduction to Bayesian Neural Networks in Edward\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to Bayesian methods in Neural Networks, and should be an in-depth introduction to Bayesian inference methods and probabilistic modeling. Prior knowledge of basic probability theory is recommended before tackling all the concepts in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the [table of contents](#TOC), this tutorial first sets up the problem of Bayesian linear regression along with an introduction to Bayesian infererence. Then we illustrate an implementation of BLR in Edward, and then move onto an introduction to approximate inference methods. From there, we tackle an implementation of a convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST digit dataset. If you are already familiar with inference and Bayesian statistics, and are more interested in the workings of Edward with neural nets, you can go directly to the example implementation in [section 3](#EdwardCNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the code in this notebook, the primary python library used to model BNNs is [Edward](http://edwardlib.org), a tensorflow library designed for probablistic modeling, and most importantly, approximate Bayesian inference and modeling. Make sure tensorflow, numpy, edward, as well as matplotlib, is properly installed before using this notebook.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "_(Note: If you have a pretty old computer, using tensorflow 1.5 or below maybe advised since a \"core dump: illegal instruction\" error may occur when importing edward. Otherwise ignore this warning)_\n",

    "Many thanks are given to Professor [Andrew Wilson](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/andrew/), who has both introduced and helped us understand many of the concepts written here."

    "### 1.1 Problem setup: simple linear regression\n",
    "Let's first tackle simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is a regression model that models an unknown relationship between two scalar entities (denoted as $x$ and $y$) as a linear relationship such that $y_i$, an ith sample of $y$, can be written as $y_i = \\beta x_i + \\epsilon$.\n",
    "More concretely, the linear regression problem is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset D with N data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i$ is the feature input for the ith data point and $y_i$ the corresponding target value for the ith data point, find $\\beta$ that minimizes the following objective:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i^N (y_i - \\beta x_i)^2 $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation commonly known as the __least squares problem__. What is also important is that the least-squares problem is mathematically equivalent to assuming the residual $y_i - \\beta x_i$, corresponding to the noise term $\\epsilon$, to be a _Gaussian white noise_. This noise has a mean at $\\mu = 0 $  with variance $\\sigma^2$, for all values of $i \\in N$. Linear regression therefore also treats $y$ as a Gaussian random variable, centered about $\\beta x$ and with variance $\\sigma^2$. We can represent this information with the following notation:\n",
    "$$ y \\sim Normal(\\beta x, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To those interested in the math, one can derive the equivalence between the least squares objective and the Gaussian distributionby examining the __likelihood__ function for the Gaussian. Given the above expression of y, the likelihood function, a function that evaluates the probability of a given sample given our assumptions of the underlying mechanics, can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} } exp(\\frac{-(y_i - \\beta x_i)^2}{\\sigma^2} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is simply the product of probability densities evaluated at each sample in the dataset. We can simply multiply the probabilities together because we consider each data point as being (conditionally) independent from each other. Our objective in linear regression to find $\\beta$ such that this expression is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizing this likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing the log of it, since $x$ and $\\log x$ always increases/decreases together. Taking the log of the likelihood and simplifying the expression shows the implicit normality assumption in least-squares regression. For those interested, the derivation is done as the following:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$argmax_\\beta \\hspace{0.25cm}\\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} } exp(\\frac{-(y_i - \\beta x_i)^2}{\\sigma^2} )$$\n",

Frequentist approaches assume that there is enough data to conclude statistically significant conclusions about $\\beta$ given the dataset, and produce a single point solution for $\\beta$. This is often the approach taken for many conventional and widely adopted machine learning practices, but can be prone to overfitting when dataset is relatively small, or with increased complexity of the loss/likelihood functions - as is the case for neural networks - suffer from lack of interpretability.\n",

    "_Bayesian_ approaches, on the other hand, avoid point estimations entirely. Rather, Bayesian method represent learned parameters - in the case for linear regression, the parameter $\\beta$ - as probability distributions rather than single optimal solutions.  This works well for many statistical modeling scenarios, where data insufficiently represents true relationships and functions due to noise or incorrect data, and thus may require us to represent _uncertainty_ in learned parameters. \n",

When size of collected samples used to train statistical model is small, this prior will have relatively significant influence on the behavior of the models, but with growing size of dataset diminish in its effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side of this equation is what we aim to learn from the data, and what is called the _posterior distribution_ over the parameters, reflecting our beliefs on the parameter __after__ data has been observed. This posterior distribution can be further expanded as shown below:\n",

Furthermore, the second term on the numerator corresponds to our prior beliefs on the parameter $\\theta$, as explained above. What is interesting is the denominator. The conversion of $P(D)$ into the integral is  the sum rule and the product rule of Bayes' Theorem, which respectively states that <br><br>\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "The first one is called the sum rule because integrals are essentially summations, and is particularly important in Bayesian statistics because it allows functions with multiple unknown random variables to collapse to functions with less parameters, known as _marginal probability densities_. Here, the denominator for the posterior corresponds to a quantity called the _marginal likelihood_, where model parameters has been marginalized out using the sum rule.

What is particularly noteworthy is that if the integral for the marginal likelihood is solvable, the posterior distribution can be directly calculated without any estimations.

    "__Prior__:   \n",
    "For this example, let's represent prior assumptions as a Gaussian with variance of 1 that is centered on a value that is different compared to the true $\\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "We deliberately impose inaccurate prior beliefs, since this is more realistic, and will be illustrate the effectiveness of Bayesian methods even with incorrect priors. Also, keep in mind that if priors were really good and the parameter precisely known, there would be no need to do inference, or for that matter, model-based learning! \n",

    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Remember to have all of these libraries installed. Here we import Normal. However, there are many types of random variables (any probability distribution you can think of is most likely in there) supported by Edward, so feel free to play around with these. We will learn in the next section that there are only certain types of random variables that allow exact Bayesian inference. However, Edward is aimed to do approximate inference, and thus can support a much wider variety of random variables.<br><br>\n",

The loc, scale arguments each correspond to the mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ (and not the variance!) and can either be assigned manually as is done here or through some learned metafeatures derived from the data.<br><br>\n",

    "This shows that the inaccurate prior - centered at 5 with a fairly small standard deviation of 1 - does not cripple Bayesian methods at all, and that inferred posterior does a very good job approximating the true beta value. Let's compare to a point estimate of the true $\\beta$ value obtained by running sklearn's linear regression module. Since our posterior distribution is a Gaussian, the point estimate and the peak of the inferred posterior above should be roughly the same. The code block used is as follows:\n",

This refers to comparing different types of models - between a linear regression and decision trees for example - or simply the same model with different hyperparameters on a given dataset, like kernel size, learning rate, and so on. Because models can all have very different values for their true marginal likelihoods, knowing the unnormalized density for the posterior of a given model makes comparison unreasonable.\n",

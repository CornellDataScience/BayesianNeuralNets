    "# Introduction to Bayesian Neural Networks in Edward\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to Bayesian methods in Neural Networks, and should be an in-depth introduction to Bayesian inference methods and probabilistic modeling. Prior knowledge of basic probability theory is recommended before tackling all the concepts in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the [table of contents](#TOC), this tutorial first sets up the problem of Bayesian linear regression along with an introduction to Bayesian infererence. Then we illustrate an implementation of BLR in Edward, and then move onto an introduction to approximate inference methods. From there, we tackle an implementation of a convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST digit dataset. If you are already familiar with inference and Bayesian statistics, and are more interested in the workings of Edward with neural nets, you can go directly to the example implementation in [section 3](#EdwardCNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the code in this notebook, the primary python library used to model BNNs is [Edward](http://edwardlib.org), a tensorflow library designed for probablistic modeling, and most importantly, approximate Bayesian inference and modeling. Make sure tensorflow, numpy, edward, as well as matplotlib, is properly installed before using this notebook.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "_(Note: If you have a pretty old computer, using tensorflow 1.5 or below maybe advised since a \"core dump: illegal instruction\" error may occur when importing edward. Otherwise ignore this warning)_\n",

    "Many thanks are given to Professor [Andrew Wilson](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/andrew/), who has both introduced and helped us understand many of the concepts written here."

    "### 1.1 Problem setup: simple linear regression\n",
    "Let's first tackle simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is a regression model that models an unknown relationship between two scalar entities (denoted as $x$ and $y$) as a linear relationship such that $y_i$, an ith sample of $y$, can be written as $y_i = \\beta x_i + \\epsilon$.\n",
    "More concretely, the linear regression problem is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset D with N data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where x_i is the feature input for the ith data point and y the corresponding target value for the ith data point, find $\\beta$ that minimizes the following objective:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i^N (y_i - \\beta x_i)^2 $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation commonly known as the __least squares problem__. What is also important is that the least-squares problem is mathematically equivalent to assuming the residual $y_i - \\beta x_i$, corresponding to the noise term $\\epsilon$, to be a _Gaussian white noise_. This noise has a mean at $\\mu = 0 $  with variance $\\sigma^2$, for all values of $i \\in N$. Linear regression therefore also treats $y$ as a Gaussian random variable, centered about $\\beta x$ and with variance $\\sigma^2$. We can represent this information with the following notation:\n",
    "$$ y \\sim Normal(\\beta x, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To those interested in the math, one can derive the equivalence between the least squares objective and the Gaussian distributionby examining the __likelihood__ function for the Gaussian. Given the above expression of y, the likelihood function, a function that evaluates the probability of a given sample given our assumptions of the underlying mechanics, can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} } exp(\\frac{-(y_i - \\beta x_i)^2}{\\sigma^2} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is simply the product of probability densities evaluated at each sample in the dataset. We can simply multiply the probabilities together because we consider each data point as being (conditionally) independent from each other. Our objective in linear regression to find $\\beta$ such that this expression is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizing this likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing the log of it, since $x$ and $\\log x$ always increases/decreases together. Taking the log of the likelihood and simplifying the expression shows the implicit normality assumption in least-squares regression. For those interested, the derivation is done as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ argmax_\\beta \\hspace{0.25cm}\\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} } exp(\\frac{-(y_i - \\beta x_i)^2}{\\sigma^2} )\\\\\n",
    "\\iff argmax_\\beta \\hspace{0.25cm}\\ln{ \\big\\{ \\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} } exp(\\frac{-(y_i - \\beta x_i)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\big\\} }\\\\ \n",
    "\\iff argmax_\\beta \\hspace{0.25cm}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\big( -\\ln{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} + \\frac{-(y_i - \\beta x_i)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\big\\}\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing the above expression to obtain an estimate of $\\beta$ above is an example of a __Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE)__ approach, or more generally speaking, a _frequentist_ approach. Frequentist approaches assume that there is enough data to conclude statistically significant conclusions about $\\beta$ given the dataset, and produce a single point solution for $\\beta$. This is often the approach taken for many conventional and widely adopted machine learning practices, but can be prone to overfitting when dataset is relatively small, or with increased complexity of the loss/likelihood functions - as is the case for neural networks - suffer from lack of interpretability.\n",

    "_Bayesian_ approaches, on the other hand, avoid point estimations entirely. Rather, Bayesian method represent learned parameters - in the case for linear regression, the parameter $\\beta$ - as probability distributions rather than single optimal solutions.  This works well for many statistical modeling scenarios, where data insufficiently represents true relationships and functions due to noise or incorrect data, and thus may require us to represent _uncertainty_ in learned parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This information on parameter uncertainties also provides prediction uncertainties, and can be incredibly useful for fields like deep learning, where model uncertainty has traditionally been poorly understood due to complexity of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",

    "At the core of Bayesian methods lies the famous Bayes' Theorem, which can be written - in a more applicable form for probabilistic modeling - as the following:<br><br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "What makes Bayesian methods different is the addition of _prior belief_ to their models on the parameter being learned, which is represented as the second term on the numerator on the above expression as $P(Parameters \\mid Model)$. When size of collected samples used to train statistical model is small, this prior will have relatively significant influence on the behavior of the models, but with growing size of dataset diminish in its effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side of this equation is what we aim to learn from the data, and what is called the _posterior distribution_ over the parameters, reflecting our beliefs on the parameter __after__ data has been observed. This posterior distribution can be further expanded as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: model and parameters all represented as $\\theta$ and data as D_\n",
    "<br><br><br>\n",

    " P(D)} \\hspace{1cm}\\iff\\hspace{1cm} P(\\theta\\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid \\theta) \\cdot P(\\theta)}{\n",
    "\\int P(D \\mid \\theta) \\cdot P(\\theta)\\hspace{0.1cm}d\\theta}$$\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Notice that the first term on the numerator, $P(D \\mid \\theta)$ corresponds to the _likelihood_ of the data given model parameters, as we have already discussed in the previous section. Furthermore, the second term on the numerator corresponds to our prior beliefs on the parameter $\\theta$, as explained above. What is interesting is the denominator. The conversion of $P(D)$ into the integral is  the sum rule and the product rule of Bayes' Theorem, which respectively states that <br><br>\n",
    "$$P(x) \\iff \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{P(x \\cap y)\\hspace{0.1cm}dy} \\hspace{3cm}P(x,y)\\iff P(x\\mid y)\\cdot p(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is called the sum rule because integrals are essentially summations, and is particularly important in Bayesian statistics because it allows functions with multiple unknown random variables to collapse to functions with less parameters, known as _marginal probability densities_. Here, the denominator for the posterior corresponds to a quantity called the _marginal likelihood_, where model parameters has been marginalized out using the sum rule. Therefore the above expression is also written as<br><br>\n",
    "$$ \\text{Posterior} \\iff \\frac{\\text{Likelihood} \\cdot \\text{Prior} }{\\text{Marginal Likelihood}} $$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "The process of evaluating this expression, hence learning the parameters of a proposed statistical model, is called __inference__, and is the most important part of Bayesian modeling. What is particularly noteworthy is that if the integral for the marginal likelihood is solvable, the posterior distribution can be directly calculated without any estimations. The difficulty in Bayesian methods arise from models where the marginal likelihood cannot be directly evaluated, as will be fully explained in [section 2](#ApproxInf)\n",

    "\n",
    "__Prior__:   \n",
    "For this example, let's represent prior assumptions as a Gaussian with variance of 1 that is centered on a value that is different compared to the true $\\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "We deliberately impose inaccurate prior beliefs, since this is more realistic, and will be illustrate the effectiveness of Bayesian methods even with incorrect priors. Also, keep in mind that if priors were really good and the parameter precisely known, there would be no need to do inference, or for that matter, model-based learning! \n",

    "import edward as ed\n",
    "from edward.models import Normal\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Remember to have all of these libraries installed. Here we import Normal. However, there are many types of random variables (any probability distribution you can think of is most likely in there) supported by Edward, so feel free to play around with these. We will learn in the next section that there are only certain types of random variables that allow exact Bayesian inference. However, Edward is aimed to do approximate inference, and thus can support a much wider variety of random variables.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The model used to instantiate the posterior determines the functional form of the _prior distribution_, which is the Gaussian/Normal distribution here. The loc, scale arguments each correspond to the mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ (and not the variance!) and can either be assigned manually as is done here or through some learned metafeatures derived from the data.<br><br>\n",

    "This shows that the inaccurate prior - centered at 5 with a fairly small standard deviation of 1 - does not cripple Bayesian methods at all, and that inferred posterior does a very good job approximating the true beta value. Let's compare to a point estimate of the true $\\beta$ value obtained by running sklearn's linear regression module. Since our posterior distribution is a Gaussian, the point estimate and the peak of the inferred posterior above should be roughly the same. The code block used is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the sections presented so far, we've shown how inference can work for a relatively straightforward case of simple linear regression with a Normal prior and have demonstrated a working implementation in Edward. However, we previously observed that Edward implements an iterative algorithm - with a function called KLqp - that approximates, rather than analytically solve for the posterior distribution. What is the approximation technique used/available on Edward and why do we approximate to start with? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we first explain when approximate inference is necessary or recommended, ands introduce two popular branches of such approximate inference techniques: __Variational Inference (VI)__ and __Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)__.\n",

    "### 2.1 Limits of Exact Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we explained that to do exact inference for the posterior, we evaluate the Bayes' formula:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{P(D \\mid \\theta) \\cdot P(\\theta)}{\n",
    "\\int P(D \\mid \\theta) \\cdot P(\\theta)\\hspace{0.1cm}d\\theta} \\hspace{.5cm} \\iff \\hspace{.75cm} \\frac{\\text{Likelihood}\\cdot{\\text{Prior}}}{\\text{Marginal Likelihood}}$$ \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical component here is the integral in the denominator, or the _marginal likelihood_. The posterior can only be exactly evaluated if this integral is tractable, and therefore, solvable. This is true only for a very limited range of distribution families, which includes the exponential family - the Gaussian being the most prominent member -,the Gamma distribution, the Beta distribution and so on. However, for many complex hiearchical models, such as neural nets, the integral is in fact intractable and therefore cannot be exactly solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to tackling this limitation. One tries to estimate the true posterior with a probability distribution that makes the integral tractable, and is called variational inference. The other approach, Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo, samples directly from the posterior using Markov chains, evaluate the likelihood * prior over these samples and use the results instead of evaluating the integral."

    "While marginal likelihood typically impedes exact inference of the posterior, one may observe that the marginal likelihood can be regarded somewhat as a normalizing constant, and that in fact if we were simply interested in the shape of the posterior, one could use the relationship:\n",

    "to get an unnormalized density proportional to the true posterior, avoiding the pesky integral entirely. So why would we use approximate inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part is that the marginal likelihood, also called _model evidence_, is used for _model comparison_. This refers to comparing different types of models - between a linear regression and decision trees for example - or simply the same model with different hyperparameters on a given dataset, like kernel size, learning rate, and so on. Because models can all have very different values for their true marginal likelihoods, knowing the unnormalized density for the posterior of a given model makes comparison unreasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian model comparison uses the Bayes' Theorem again, where this time we try to evaluate the posterior probability of a model given data: \n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "Notice that to evaluate this we need the marginal likelihood, labelled in the above equation as 'model evidence', as previously stated.

    "### 2.2 Variational Inference\n",
    "Variational inference is a very popular Bayesian method used for approximate inference, particularly for either intractable integrals. Intuitively, VI approximates a complex distribution with an intractable marginal likelihoods with those with known analytical solutions. Alternatively, one may also use VI for very high-dimensional but tractable distributions in order to reduce the computational load of inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below is an example of what VI attempts to do. P in this case is the _true density_ with a potentially intractable marginal likelihood. Q here is a _proposal distribution_, in the form a Gaussian distribution, that approximates P. While they may not be exact, a close enough Q can yield very similar and reliable results in inference and predictions. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This procedure is typically done by minimizing a distance measure between two distributions known as __KL divergence__ using stochastic gradient descent(SGD). While variational inference as a method has existed for quite some time, its newfound popularity is due to advances in SGD, as well as advances in calculating what is known as Evidence Lower Bound, which provides an estimate of the lower bound for the marginal likelihood, which has allowed variational inference to be effective in a much wider family of distributions.<br><br>\n",
    "__ 2.2.1 KL divergence__  \n",
    "\n",
    "KL divergence, or the Kullback-Leibler divergence, is a distance measure between two density functions that has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{kl}(P\\mid\\mid Q)= -\\int_{i} P(i) \\log{\\frac{Q(i)}{P(i)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice, sampling is used to compare the two distributions, since this is much more computationally tractable, and therefore the KL divergence formula more useful is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{kl}(P\\mid\\mid Q)= -\\sum_{i} P(i) \\log{\\frac{Q(i)}{P(i)}} $$\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "This is an important distinction, as the two metrics will differ in the outcome they produce. Minimizing $D_{KL}(P \\mid \\mid Q)$ encourages Q to be small in areas that P is small, since P is in the denominator for the log expression. Whereas minimizing $D_{KL}(Q \\mid \\mid P)$ drives Q to be large where P is large, and may even drive Q towards the largest peak of P. A visualization is shown below:\n",

Blue line is driven towards the largest peak as expected, where as green line approximates it more broadly over a region of relatively high mass. Each approximation can have its own advantages and disadvantages. However  $D_{KL}(Q \\mid \\mid P)$ can be problematic when the highest peak is very sharp, and does not necessarily represent the majority of the true distribution, such as the following distribution:<br><br>\n",
